        <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 egg whites, at room temperature00</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 pint whole strawberries, stems removed</li>

    </ul>


    <h3><u>Pasos</u></h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a bowl. Beat egg whites in a second bowl until foamy with a thick, ribbony texture, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in 1/4 of the sugar mixture until completely incorporated, about 30 seconds. Repeat with the remaining sugar mixture, whisking after each addition, until all is incorporated and egg whites are glossy and thick</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and vinegar; whisk until you can lift the beater or whisk straight up and egg whites form a sharp peak that holds its shape, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon egg white mixture onto the prepared baking sheet; spread out into a 2x6-inch disk.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven, crack open the oven door, and let the Pavlova cool for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled Pavlova to a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Whip cream, sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in a bowl until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Spread over Pavlova and top with fresh strawberries</li>

    </ol>
